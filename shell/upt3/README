cx that adds execute permission. See also chmod.sh, chmod.csh. (See article
        50.8.)
[Overview] [List]

dateprompt.sh

dateprompt.sh sets a prompt on old Bourne shells that don't support other ways
to set the promot dynamically. It works by starting a background program that
periodically updates the prompt string and sends a signal to the shell, which
traps that signal. (See article 4.15.) Most modern shells don't need this
kludge to set a prompt, but the technique (sending a signal to your shell) is
still useful to know.
[Overview] [List]

dd

dd is a handy (but cryptic) utility for processing text. (See article 21.6.)
    It's part of the GNU fileutils.
[Overview] [List]

dedent

dedent is a directly-executable sed script that removes all whitespace from
the beginning of each line of text. (See article 5.21.) If your system can't
directly execute files starting with #!, add a shell wrapper; see article
36.3.
[Overview] [List]

del

del is a file-removing shell script that works more quickly, for large numbers
of files, than rm -i. If there are three or fewer files to remove, it runs rm
-i; otherwise, it shows all of the filenames and asks you just once. Train
your fingers to use del -- instead of aliasing rm to actually run rm -i, which
can be dangerous if you go to an account without that alias and expect an
interactive file-removal command. (See article 14.7.)
[Overview] [List]

deroff

deroff removes troff-style formatting markup from manual page sources and
other similar files. (See article 16.9.)

    * Home page: http://www.moria.de/~michael/deroff/

Expect scripts to automate these interactions. Then the Expect script can run
the "interactive" program non-interactively. (See article 28.18.) Expect
programs are almost always written using Tcl/tk.
[Overview] [List]

exrc

The exrc file is a collection of vi and ex commands that are shown throughout
the book. Others aren't shown in the book and are only available in this file.
In its distribution form, each set of commands is commented out and needs to
be explicitly uncommented before you can use them; this is because many of the
definitions override or conflict with one another. You can copy this file into
your .exrc file, and then enable the definitions that you want. (See articles
        18.5, 18.11, and 18.13.)
[Overview] [List]

fac.sh

fac.sh is a Bourne shell function that uses recursion to calculate factorials.
It's meant more for demonstration than for serious use: most shells, except
zsh, will quickly overflow and give incorrect results. (See article 29.11.)
[Overview] [List]

false

The false utility simply returns a nonzero exit status. It's so simple that
this GNU version doesn't add any functionality to the version available on
almost all Unix-type systems -- so you probably won't need to install this.
It's part of the GNU shellutils. (See article 35.12.) See also true.
[Overview] [List]

file

The file utility reads the file(s) named on its command line and tries to
guess the file type. (Because Unix-type systems and utilities generally don't
        require filename "extensions" like .txt, a file with any name can
        contain almost anything.) (See article 12.6.)
[Overview] [List]

fileutils

The GNU file utilities have significant advantages over their standard UNIX
counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer arbitrary
limits. Programs included are: chmod, chgrp, chown, cp, dd, df, du, install,
    ln, ls, mkdir, mkfifo, mknod, mv, rm, rmdir, and touch. Most of these
    programs are covered throughout the book.

1, that you can use instead. (See article 9.26.)
[Overview] [List]

find.sh

find.sh has two Bourne shell functions, named Find and Findls, that use the
find operator -prune to do searches in the current directory only. If your

    * http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/gzip.html

[Overview] [List]

hgrep

hgrep is a trivial, but cute, front-end for grep. It takes the results of the
grep and highlights the word that was searched for. (See article 13.16.)
[Overview] [List]

if-else-alias.csh

if-else-alias.csh demonstrates how to put an if-else-endif test into a C shell
alias. It isn't pretty, but it works (as far as we know... if it doesn't work
        on your csh, please tell us!). (See article 29.9.)
[Overview] [List]

ispell

ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows your errors in
the context of the original file, and suggests possible corrections when it
can figure them out. Compared to UNIX spell, it is faster and much easier to
use. ispell can also handle languages other than English. (See article 16.2.)

relational database "join" operation. It's part of the GNU textutils. (See
        article 21.19.)
[Overview] [List]

lensort

lensort sorts lines from shortest to longest. (See article 22.7.)
[Overview] [List]

lndir

lndir is a safe way to duplicate a directory structure elsewhere on the
filesystem. It's necessary because a cd into a straight symbolic link actually
changes to the directory pointed to by the link, which can be confusing or
even dangerous if the link is in a sensitive area of the filesystem. lndir
recursively re-creates a directory structure, making symbolic links to all the
files in the directory. (See article 10.7.)
[Overview] [List]

look

look is a fairly fast, fairly portable version of look, the program for
searching sorted files. (See article 13.14.)
[Overview] [List]

lookfor

mailto

The mailto utility encodes and sends MIME-format email messages. It's part of
the Metamail utilities. (See article 21.12.)
[Overview] [List]

makealias.csh

makealias.csh contains two C shell aliases that build other aliases. makealias
"knows" how to quote special characters within the alias definition to make
the C shell happy; to do this, it calls the quote alias. As the book's
description says, "Pretty gross, but they do the job." (See article 29.10.)
[Overview] [List]

md5sum

The md5sum utility both generates and validates file checksums. It's an
improved version of the original Unix sum utilities and comes from the GNU
textutils. (See article 50.13.)
[Overview] [List]

metamail

The Metamail utilities handle the MIME email format. Although Metamail is old
(it was released as MIME was originally being developed and standardized),
    it's still useful for scripting and decoding common MIME formats.

NOTE: Metamail has an obscure security vulnerability; see CERT advisory
CA-1997-14.html for a description and workarounds. The problem seems to be
only with incoming messages processed by metamail, not with messages you
create using mailto and mimencode, but you may want to verify this yourself.

See also mailto and mimencode.

[Overview] [List]

mimencode

The mimencode utility encodes files into the MIME format for emailing. You'll
need to add the message header and any multipart separators, so mimencode is
most useful for building messages within scripts. It's part of the Metamail
utilities. (See article 21.12.) See also mailto.
[Overview] [List]

mkfifo

The mkfifo utility creates a FIFO, a named pipe, that processes can write to

single-line prompt that there's no room left to type the command. (See article
        4.7.)
[Overview] [List]

mlprompt.sh

mlprompt.sh has short sequences of code that makes a multiline prompt for
Bourne-type shells such as ksh and bash. This is useful when you want to put
so much information in your single-line prompt that there's no room left to
type the command. (See article 4.7.)

showenv

The showenv shell script shows one or all currently-set environment variables
in another process. It depends on the /proc filesystem; note that, because
this isn't standardized on all Unix and Linux versions, showenv may not work
completely or may need to be tweaked. If you don't have /proc, you may be able
to get the same results with a command like the BSD-style ps eww and some
hacking -- or try a program that uses your system's library routines. (See
